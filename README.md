# OpenDiscord

The goal of this project is to
1. Recreate the Discord client as faithfully as possible using a very similar stack (electron and react)
2. Creating an API implementation that is compatible with the official Discord API interface

This is purely just a fun project for me that i plan to work on in my free time. This project is not affiliated with Discord in any way.
